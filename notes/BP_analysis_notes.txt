sqldf - allows you to use SQL on R data frames

if finished, break into
- completed on time (green) [green]
- completed on time but started late (amber green) [green] [?]
- completed after deadline but started on time (amber red) [red]
- completed after deadline and started late (red) [red]

if not finished & past start date, break into
- started, on track (green) [green]
- started late but not overdue (amber green) [amber]
- not started and should have been started but not overdue (amber) [amber]
- started on time but overdue (amber red) [red]
- started late and overdue (red) [red]
- overdue and past completion date (red) [red]

- not due to start (grey)


[Simple scheme]
Completed:
Green: completed on time
Red: completed late

Not completed & due to start
Green: started on time
Amber: Overdue start
Red: Past completion date

Not due to start:
Grey: not due to start

[This month]
- X completed on time
- X completed but were late
- X is currently overdue
- X is due to start this month
- x should have started by now but haven't

Percentage after election? and after next?
- per department

Calculate start and end dates for actions and priorities - from subactions

In python, create two columns for scheduled start month - one for graphing (1st) and one for calculations of due/overdue (last of the month). An action is seen as ongoing in the month in which it starts, but is not seen as overdue if it starts anytime on or before the last day of the month



Alternative breakdown:
Completed
- on time [green]
- started late but completed on time [amber]
- completed late (this includes two categories: late and regular starts) [red]

In progress
- started late [amber]
- started late and overdue [red] 
- started on time [green]

Inactive
- not due to start [green/gray]
- start overdue [amber]
- past completion date [red]

And yet another breakdown
Due to end
- started but overdue: amber
- started and finished: green
- not started and overdue: red
Due to start but not due to end
- not started but not overdue: amber
- started on time and not overdue: green
Not due to start

And yet another breakdown
Start:
- not due
- overdue or late
- accomplished on time

Finish
- not due
- overdue or late
- accomplished on time 


Minimalist:
:Finish
- not due: grey
- not due but running, started on time: blue
- not due but running, started late: purple
- overdue or late or not started: red
- accomplished on time: green
- late start but accomplished on time: amber
